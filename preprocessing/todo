1. Run utf8_to_wx.sh on hindi file.
Eg. sh utf8_to_wx.sh BUgol2.1H_utf BUgol2.1H
This will convert all hindi devnagari characters into wx script
This will aslo convert all nonascii characters lik EMdash Endash, hindi double quotes into PUNCT...labels and label_remove.lex (which ia called inside utf8_to_wx.sh will remap all these PUNCT.. big labels into machine readable characters like '," (I am keeping EMDASH and ENDASH as it is (label_remove.lex) in final result as noth english and  hindi parser is able to process these characters.))

2. Run utf8_to_wx.sh on english file to for nonascii characters like EMDASH etc.
Eg. sh utf8_to_wx.sh BUgol2.1E_nonscii BUgol2.1E

====
Keeping space on both sides of EMDAHSH and ENDASH and hyphen (Not compound hyphen)
